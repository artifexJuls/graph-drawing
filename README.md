## 🔧 About

This repo is a project based on  
🖌️ **[gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti)** by [@gelstudios](https://github.com/gelstudios) —  
a script that uses backdated commits to create ASCII art on your GitHub contribution graph.

## 💡 Why?

Because **code is structure**,  
but commits?  
Commits are *poetry*.

And when your IDE isn’t enough —  
you take your anger at the calendar lol
